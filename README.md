While learning Perl (or other laguages) sometimes you end up with some ideas about some scripts to use in your free time. I'll add some of them here

DAOcombatmech.pl is a script I did to check how will different equipment affect my character in "Dragon Age: Origins". I should finish it properly but I don't have the time, may be someone finds it useful wants to improve it.
